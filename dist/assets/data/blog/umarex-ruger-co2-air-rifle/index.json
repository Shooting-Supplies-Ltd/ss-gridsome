The Air Rifle is powered by 2x 12g CO2 canisters and uses a 10 round magazine that is pretty close to the original design.</p>\n<p>With excellent accuracy and consistency, there is plenty of fun to be had with this gun, it is ideal as a backyard plinker and can be used to deal with small vermin.</p>\n<p>One unique feature of the Umarex Ruger 10/22 Air Rifle is the trigger. The 10/22 has a 10 lb double-action pull, but cocking the charging handle on the rifle turns it into a single action trigger and reduces the weight to 3 lbs.</p>\n<p>The Umarex Ruger 10/22 Air Rifle is a lightweight and authentic replica of the original and is likely to garner a significant fan base included both new and experienced shooters.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 0;\"><div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 25px; height: 0;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N69Xo94PJ2s\"></iframe></div></div></p>\n","excerpt":"The Umarex Ruger 10/22 CO2 Air Rifle is a fantastic looking replica of the original rimfire rifle from Ruger.","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/shooting-supplies/image/upload/v1574436181/Umarex-Ruger-10-22-CO2-Air-Rifle_nn3cu5.jpg"}},"context":{}}
