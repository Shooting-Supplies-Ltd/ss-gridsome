Twist it left to reduce brightness and right to increase it. Having this level of control means that you can put out just enough light. If you do white-out your target, simply reduce the brightness until you get a good image through the scope. LEDs are changeable, as is the head, to give you ultimate control.</p>\n<h2>Night Master IC 400 IR Illuminator Features</h2>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>LED: High power LED with brightness control function</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery: 1 or 2 x 18650, 2 x CR123A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function: Twist the rotary tail switch left to reduce brightness and right to increase it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Switch: Protruding foward clicky tail switch.
