Exposed turrets bring tracking performance previously unheard of at this price point, while its optical system delivers sharp image quality even at extended range. Its relatively simple design places you firmly in the driver's seat with the potential to take on that 1,000yd mark and beyond, all at a price that's easy to justify for new shooters, your training rifle, as well as experienced shooters looking for a back-to-basics optic on their fun gun. </p>\n<p>Opt for one of the first focal plane models on a sweet-shooting rifle and you've got yourself a perfectly capable competition rig without breaking the bank.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"225\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 225px; margin-top: 2em;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K2saBwF1YFY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vortex Diamondback Tactical 6-24X50 FFP MOA Rifle Scope Specifications:</h2>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Magnification</td>\n<td>6-24x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Objective Lens Diameter</td>\n<td>50 mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eye Relief</td>\n<td>3.9 inches</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Field of View</td>\n<td>18-4.5 ft/100 yds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tube Size</td>\n<td>30 mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Turret Style</td>\n<td>Tall Exposed Tactical</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjustment Graduation</td>\n<td>1/4 MOA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Travel Per Rotation</td>\n<td>15 MOA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Elevation Adjustment</td>\n<td>65 MOA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Windage Adjustment</td>\n<td>65 MOA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parallax Setting</td>\n<td>10 yards to infinity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Length</td>\n<td>14.5 inches</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>24.6 oz</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n","price":"499.95","stockStatus":"instock","categories":[{"id":4094,"name":"Optics"},{"id":324,"name":"Scopes"}],"images":[{"src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/shooting-supplies/image/upload/v1575031949/Vortex-Diamondback-Tactical-6-24x50_ws4ln8_urtnim_c6xwfq.jpg"}],"brands":[{"id":421,"name":"Vortex"}]}}
