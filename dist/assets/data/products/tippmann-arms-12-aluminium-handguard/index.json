The M-LOK design allows mounting of bipods, grips, lights, lasers and optics. </p>\n<p>Free float handguards are known to improve accuracy.  The accuracy of the free-floating handguard comes from the fact that the handguard doesn’t touch the barrel – it is mounted directly to the upper receiver. This allows the barrel to “float” and gives better harmonics, resulting in slightly increased accuracy.</p>\n<p>Accuracy difference is especially evident when using grips or bipods. When you rest a rifle on a bipod that is attached to the barrel, or a drop-in handguard, the bipod will create force that can slightly warp the barrel. This small amount of warping can provide fairly significant accuracy issues on the range. But with a free-float handguard, you can put all kinds of force on the handguard and it won't affect the barrel whatsoever.</p>\n","price":"139.95","stockStatus":"instock","categories":[{"id":4091,"name":"Handguard"},{"id":225,"name":"Spares &amp; Accessories"}],"images":[{"src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/shooting-supplies/image/upload/v1575031928/12_M-Lok_Aluminum_Free_Float_copy__04191.1530026386-1_jryeqs_is4rho_mdkldp.jpg"}],"brands":[{"id":219,"name":"Tippmann Arms"}]}}
