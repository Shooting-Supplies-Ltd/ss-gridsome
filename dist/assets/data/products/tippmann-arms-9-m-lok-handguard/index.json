The M-LOK design allows mounting of bipods, grips, lights, lasers and optics. </p>\n<p>Free float handguards are known to improve accuracy. The increased accuracy gained by using a free-floating handguard is due to the fact that the handguard doesn’t touch the barrel, it is mounted directly to the upper receiver, allowing the barrel to “float” and giving better harmonics and resulting in slightly increased accuracy.</p>\n<p>The accuracy difference when using a free floating handguard is especially evident when using grips or bipods. When you rest a rifle on a bipod that is attached to the barrel, or a drop-in handguard, the bipod will create force that can slightly warp the barrel. This small amount of warping can provide fairly significant accuracy issues on the range. With a free-float handguard, you can put all kinds of force on the handguard and it won't affect the barrel whatsoever.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Tippmann Arms 9\" M-LOK Handguard Features:</h3>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>M-LOK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aluminum construction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Comes with Barrel Nut</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anodized Black Finish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increased Accuracy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Full Length Picatinny Rail</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weighs only 7.1oz</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n","price":"139.95","stockStatus":"instock","categories":[{"id":4091,"name":"Handguard"},{"id":225,"name":"Spares &amp; Accessories"}],"images":[{"src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/shooting-supplies/image/upload/v1575031929/9_M-Lok_Aluminum_cmzscf_j0mnjy_whsjjs.jpg"},{"src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/shooting-supplies/image/upload/v1575031930/Pistol_w_9inch_Free_Float_eu2jqt_ncwmrm_thawcq.jpg"}],"brands":[{"id":219,"name":"Tippmann Arms"}]}}
