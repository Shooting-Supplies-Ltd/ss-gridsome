Your household insurance policy may not be covering your guns & equipment. As a result we have partnered with Hiscox to offer our customers a discounted rate on their Gunguard policy.

### What is shooting insurance and why would I need it?

Household insurance often contains restrictions on cover, especially when items are taken out of the home. Specifically most policies will not cover your gun whilst in use.

Hiscox Gunguard is a specialist insurance policy to cover your guns and accessories.

### What this shooting insurance policy cover?

The policy provides specialist cover for all of your sporting guns (shotguns, rifles and airguns) and accessories (scopes/rangefinders/spotting scopes, gunslips etc.) anywhere in the World except the USA / Canada, up to the sum insured selected.

The policy will cover you at home, on the range, at the clay ground, rough shooting, field target, at Game Fairs – in fact during all of your sporting shooting activities.

You can also select further personal Personal Liability cover for your shooting activities if required - with a printable 'certificate' that you can use to prove cover.

Repair or replacement in the event of a loss at your local / normal Registered Firearms Dealer.

Low excess - £25
