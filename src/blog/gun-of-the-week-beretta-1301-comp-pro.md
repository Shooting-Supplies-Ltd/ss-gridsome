Beratta's Kick Off Plus system consists of 2x dampeners and return springs which combined enable a reduction in recoil by up to 40%. A third damper, located in the stock bolt, absorbs the impact of the slide against the stock. Reducing the second recoil, muzzle jump and vibrations caused by the movement of the slide.

Featuring an ultra-fast, safe loading system and new oversized cocking handle and bolt release lever. The **1301 Comp Pro** is the most competitive dynamic shooting platform around. 

Providing further comfort, the comb comes with Soft Comb, a soft insert which is gentle against the cheek. The rubber Comfort Gripimproves sensitivity and pistol grip, providing maximum grip even in poor weather conditions.

The 1301 Comp Pro provides plenty of capacity for further personalisation and as a result is a very sought after shotgun.
