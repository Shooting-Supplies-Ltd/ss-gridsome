Swiss powder is well established in the reloading world and is used by many top competative shooters, providing uniform quality and burn performance.

With the new EU legislation restricting the sale of many of the American made powders (Hodgdon and Alliant) it gives more options when looking for a replacement for the likes of Varget or Reloader 15. We are running it along side the full range of Vihtavuori powders too. We can also supply solid load data for most rifle and pistol calibres.
