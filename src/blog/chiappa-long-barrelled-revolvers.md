The Chiappa Rhino long barrelled pistols have arrived just in time for Christmas.

We have waited a good 6 months for these and they feel even better than they look.

Equipped with a great trigger and even better balance, they are nicely presented with a hard case and 3 moon clips to get you going.

So far we have received 357cal and 9mm in Black and Chrome finish.

The 44 Magnums should be arriving at the end of January. Different size grips will soon be available too.
