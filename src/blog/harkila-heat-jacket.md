Using the app available for either Android or iPhone you can select your desired temperature anywhere between 30C and 52C and your not tied to your phone to operate the heating on this jacket as you can simply push the button on the jacket to select either 38C, 46C or 52C.

The Harkila Heat Jacket features a heat-reflecting lining that both prevents heat loss and enhances the performance of the jacket’s heating membranes.

Unlike older heating technologies, the heating membranes on this jacket are flexible enough to be folded up and packed away with the garment they are sewn into and the jacket can also be machine-washed without issue.
